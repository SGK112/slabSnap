STONE SWAP - WHY YOU DON'T SEE CHANGES YET
===========================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
---------------
✅ 4 new files created (10.3 KB of code)
✅ Achievements system (11 achievements)
✅ Daily streaks tracking
✅ Points & levels system
✅ Referral program
✅ Social sharing functions

WHY NO VISIBLE CHANGES:
-----------------------
The gamification features were CREATED but NOT YET INTEGRATED into the UI.

Think of it like this:
- We built all the LEGO pieces ✅
- But didn't assemble them into the building yet ❌

WHAT'S MISSING:
---------------
1. No streak counter showing in the app
2. No share buttons on listings
3. No "Invite Friends" button
4. No achievement popups
5. No level/points display

THE FILES EXIST BUT AREN'T CONNECTED TO THE SCREENS.

HOW TO FIX:
-----------
The screens need to be updated to USE the new features:

HomeScreen.tsx needs:
- Import useGamificationStore
- Call updateStreak() on mount
- Show streak counter in header
- Add share button to each listing

ProfileScreen.tsx needs:
- Show streak
- Display level & points
- Show achievements grid
- Add referral code section
- Add "Invite Friends" button

CreateListingScreen.tsx needs:
- Call unlockAchievement('first_listing')

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
Backend/Logic: ✅ COMPLETE (100%)
UI Integration: ❌ NOT STARTED (0%)

WHAT YOU'LL SEE WHEN INTEGRATED:
---------------------------------
🔥 "5 Day Streak!" in header
🏆 Achievement popup: "First Steps +5 credits"
📊 "Level 3 - 250/300 XP"
👥 "Your Code: STONE123ABC" 
📱 Share button on every listing
⬆️ Points increase with actions

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
I can integrate these features into the UI screens, but that requires modifying 3-4 screen files to actually USE the gamification stores and functions.

The foundation is built. Now needs UI integration to be visible.
